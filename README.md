## Data Preprocessing
    What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? 
        Successful and USE_CASE
    What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
        Special Considerations_Y
    What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
        Special Considerations_N  
## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
        2 layers and 3 and 5 neurons. Activation funcstions Sigmoid for the layers and Relu for output layer.
    Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
        No. My data seemed to be overfitting.
    What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
